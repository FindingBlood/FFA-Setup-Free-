Hi, My name is BloodRiver! And I'll help you to create your: Minecraft Pvp Server Setup! (free). Part- 1

First, we have to know requirements to create a pvp server! 
Requirements:
1: Hosting
2: Plugin (free or paid)
3: Configuration
4: Icons and Motd (Message of the Day)

• Hosting: For creating a public pvp server we have to choose a host which offers good Product! Minimum we want some things like:

1: 8 gb ram server minimum (for 50 to 100 players)
2: C.P.U at least we want to amount of 500% cpu. 
3: Disk at least we want 5 to 8 gb Disk.
4: Slots (Bonus) Player slots also matters because if you have created your new minecraft server, Players will take some time to know your server.
So, I will be better if you set your server slots to 20 to 50.

• Plugins: For creating any type of minecraft server Plugins are very nessacary! [Accept Survival]. Without plugin any type of server cannot be made. Some basic plugins which are quite essential for a PvP server are:

1: Via version (For new minecraft version/clients players)
2: Via backwards (For old minecraft version/clients players)
3: Nlogin or any other secure login plugin (For security)
4: EssentialsX (For warps and Other Configurations)
5: Clearlagg (For removing dropped entities to reduce lag)
6: Duels/Phoenix duels (For dueling a player [1v1])
7: Player kits 2 (For creating kits to give everyone)
7: Citizens/Znpcs (For Creating Npc)
8: FastAsyncWorldEdit/World edit for Bukkit (For placing lobbys, arenas, maps, etc things where you want)
9: World Guard (For Protecting Blocks that you don't want to be breaded by comman Citizens)
10: TAB (For creating tablist and Scoreboards)
11: Luckperms (For giving player permission that you want according to their ranks)

These are some basic plugins to create a server. We can Also add more to make out server more good and engaging.

• Configuration: Now, I'll tell you how you can config your plugind to Make your server more good! 

1: Via Version [No Configuration]
2: Via Backwards [No Configuration]
3: Nlogin [You can configure your title and message! Means, when player joins your server! Title comes (in green color) "Login" with subtitle (in Grey color) Use /login <password>. It comes only when you have already registered in that server! On joining first time it shows title (in green color) "Register" with subtitle (in Grey color) use /register <password> <confirm Password>]
